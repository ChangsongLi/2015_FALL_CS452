Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence, or AI, was once a topic of science fiction and idle speculation, but is now part of the everyday world.  Web search, airfare bookings, automated call-answering services, image processing of postal addresses, semi-autonomous vehicles and robots, video game NPC logicâ€”all of these technologies use algorithms and ideas that originate in AI research.
